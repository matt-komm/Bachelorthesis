Physics analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In high energy and astroparticle physics physicists are often confronted
 with a large amount of data to handle and analyze.
 The performed analysis can also become very complex.
 This is where the common term 'physics analysis' appears.
 For an introductory example, I present in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Feyman-graph:Z0"

\end_inset

 the feyman diagram of the simple reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow Z^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$
\end_inset

 which can takes place at the interaction point in a particle accelerator.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data can be collect by using a particle detector.
 In the detector the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{0}$
\end_inset

 is not measured due to a decay width of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{Z^{0}}=2.495\, GeV$
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "databooklet"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the collect data includes only information about the final state
 particles, in this case the muons
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Plus all known parameters of the accelerator (eg.
 the center mass energy 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{s}$
\end_inset

) and detector (eg.
 which trigger has fired).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If the detector is designed to do so, special computer software in interaction
 with the electronics of the detector can determine the four-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 of the muons.
 For more details how this can be done see Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "muonreco"

\end_inset

.
 Then the experimenters can easily accessing this reconstructed data and
 perform there analysis.
 An example analysis with the obtained data can be the measurement of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{0}$
\end_inset

 mass which is calculated by the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
|p_{Z^{0}}|=|(p_{\mu,1}+p_{\mu,2})|=m_{Z^{0}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get a statistical sufficient amount for a scientific statement of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{0}$
\end_inset

 mass, this calculation has to be done for a great number of same reactions.
 We consider also that before that, the desired reaction has to be singled
 out of all other collected data, which contains of course many other reactions.
 Therefore this simple example of a physics analysis has to be programmed
 to run on a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Programming with C++
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today's standard programming language for physics analysis is C++.
 This has some major reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
C++ is very near to a machine language and therefore written C++ programs
 are a lot faster than any other programs written in a high level language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Programming with C++ supports both basic programming styles: procedural
 and object oriented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is platform independent.
 This means, everybody can create a software package or a class library
 and distribute the source code.
 A favorite class library for example is ROOT
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ROOT"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But performing an analysis with a self written computer program has also
 its disadvantages.
 First, the user has to learn a complex programming language which is normally
 not the field of application for a physicist.
 Another effect is that the physics are losing focus because changes or
 new implementations of the analysis need more time to translate them into
 the code.
 In addition, the produced source code has to be maintained and can not
 easily exchanged with other experimenters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Applications in a web browser
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite of a pure source code based analysis is a graphical designed
 analysis.
 An example for such an environment is LabView
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LabView"

\end_inset

 (mainly used in electrical engineering), where no learning of a programing
 language is required.
 This improves the clearness, and exchangeability of an analysis a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further development of graphical applications is provided by the Internet.
 It's so-called Web 2.0 technologies
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "web20"

\end_inset

 opens new possibilities for various web applications (apps) which runs
 in every standard web browser.
 For example in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Web-mail-client:"

\end_inset

 a web mail client, IMP5
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
The following advantages of a browser based application against a local
 application/own programed analysis makes this concept very attractive for
 physics analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no need for an operating system based installation on the client.
 Only a web browser with support for Web 2.0
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The concrete support for a feature is specified in the supporting HTML standard
 of a browser.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The user needs no administrator rights to run a new application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A application runs on the client with only the front-end.
 The back-end runs on the server.
 Therefore, the application uses the server computing resources and becomes
 independent of the client's computer hardware/environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my thesis, I will demonstrate, how these new technologies can be used
 for developing a graphical physics analysis environment as a web application
 and how to perform a physics analysis with it.
