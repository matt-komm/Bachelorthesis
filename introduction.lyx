Physics analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In high energy and astroparticle physics physicists are often confronted
 with a large amount of data to deal with.
 The performed analysis can become very complex and this is where the common
 term 'physics analysis' appears.
 For an introductory example, I present in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Feyman-graph:Z0"

\end_inset

 the Feyman diagram of the simple reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow Z^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$
\end_inset

 which can take place at the interaction point in a particle accelerator.

\begin_layout Standard
In a particle detector the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{0}$
\end_inset

 is not measured due to a decay width of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{Z^{0}}=2.495\, GeV$
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "databooklet"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the collected data includes only information about the final
 state particles, in this case the muons
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Plus all known parameters of the accelerator, e.g.
 the center mass energy √ s, and all parameters of the detector, e.g.
 which trigger has ﬁred.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Special computer software in interaction with the electronics of the detector
 can determine the four-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 of the muons.
 For more details how this can be done see Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "muonreco"

\end_inset

.
 Then the experimenters can easily access this reconstructed data and perform
 their analyses.
 A sample analysis can be conducted with the obtained data by measuring
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{0}$
\end_inset

 mass which is calculated by the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
|p_{Z^{0}}|=|(p_{\mu,1}+p_{\mu,2})|=m_{Z^{0}}\label{eq:vghj}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get a statistically sufficient amount for a scientific statement of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{0}$
\end_inset

 mass, this calculation has to be done for a huge number of like reactions.
 It also needs to be considered that the desired reaction has to be singled
 out of all other collected data, which contains of course many other reactions.
 To perform this simple example of a physics analysis, it is sufficient
 to write a computer program for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Programming with C++
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today's standard programming language for physics analyses is C++.
 This has some major reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
C++ programs can be optimized to run very fast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Programming with C++ supports the two programming styles: procedural and
 object-oriented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is platform independent.
 This means, everybody can create a software package or a class library
 and distribute the source code.
 A favorite class library for example is ROOT
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ROOT"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But performing an analysis with a self-written computer program has also
 its disadvantages.
 First of all, the user has to learn a complex programming language which
 is normally not the field of application for a physicist.
 Another effect is that the physicist might loose the focus because changes
 or new implementations of the analysis need more time to translate them
 into code.
 In addition, the produced source code has to be maintained and can not
 easily be exchanged with other experimenters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphically designed analyses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite of a pure source code based analysis is a graphical designed
 analysis.
 An example for such an environment is Lab View
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LabView"

\end_inset

 (mainly used in electrical engineering), where no learning of a complex
 programing language like C++ is required.
 Here, a developed analysis gains more clarity through the graphical visualizati
on and improves the exchangeability of the analysis a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Applications in a web browser
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further development of graphical applications is driven by the advance
 of the Internet.
 It's so-called Web 2.0 technologies
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "web20"

\end_inset

 opens new possibilities for various web applications (apps), which run
 in every standard web browser.
 For example in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Web-mail-client:"

\end_inset

 a web mail client, DIMP
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
The following advantages of a browser based application in contrast to a
 graphical application/ self-programmed analysis make this concept very
 attractive for physics analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is no need for an operating system based installation on the client.
 Only prerequisite is a web browser supporting Java Script
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The exact support for a feature is specified in the supporting HTML standard
 of a browser.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The user needs no administrator rights to run a new application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An application runs on the client with only the front-end.
 The back-end runs on the server.
 Therefore, the application uses the server computing resources and becomes
 independent of the client's computer hardware/environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, I will demonstrate, how these new technologies can be used
 for developing a graphical physics analysis environment as a web application
 and how to perform a physics analysis with it.
